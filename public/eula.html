        <h1>End User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Onit Invoice Builder (Private App)</div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="meta-info">
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>App Name:</strong> Onit Invoice Builder (the "App")</p>
        <p><strong>Owner:</strong> Onit Incorporated ("Onit," "we," "us")</p>
        <p><strong>Audience:</strong> Onit employees and Onit-authorized representatives only ("you")</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="intro">
        This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") governs your access to and use of the App, a private application that enables creation of customized QuickBooks invoices from within Pipedrive CRM. By installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to this Agreement.
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h2>1) Eligibility and Authorized Use</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1 Authorized Users Only.</strong> You may use the App only if you are (a) an employee of Onit or (b) an authorized representative acting on Onit's behalf and approved by Onit.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2 Business Use Only.</strong> The App is intended solely for Onit's internal business purposes and authorized client/service activities approved by Onit.</p>
        <p><strong>1.3 Account Requirement.</strong> Use of the App may require active accounts for Pipedrive and QuickBooks (or QuickBooks Online) and appropriate permissions in those systems.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h2>2) License Grant and Restrictions</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1 Limited License.</strong> Subject to this Agreement, Onit grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App solely for Authorized Use.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Restrictions.</strong> You will not, and will not allow others to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>copy, modify, translate, or create derivative works of the App except as expressly permitted by Onit in writing;</li>
          <li>reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms;</li>
          <li>circumvent security controls or access the App outside permitted roles/permissions;</li>
          <li>use the App for any unlawful purpose or to process data you are not authorized to access;</li>
          <li>sell, sublicense, rent, lease, or provide the App to any third party;</li>
          <li>use the App to transmit malware, spam, or content that violates law or third-party rights.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h2>3) App Functionality and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>3.1 Integrations.</strong> The App may connect with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pipedrive CRM (to read or use deal/contact/company/product/invoice-related information), and</li>
          <li>QuickBooks (to create and/or update invoices and related accounting records).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>3.2 Third-Party Terms.</strong> Pipedrive, QuickBooks/Intuit, and any related services are third-party services ("Third-Party Services"). Your use of Third-Party Services is governed by their terms, not this Agreement. Onit does not control Third-Party Services and is not responsible for their availability, security, or behavior.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3 No Affiliation.</strong> QuickBooks is a product of Intuit and Pipedrive is provided by its respective owner. The App is not endorsed by or affiliated with those providers except as applicable via their developer/integration programs.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h2>4) Access, Authentication, and Credentials</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1 Authentication.</strong> The App may use OAuth or similar methods to connect to Third-Party Services.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Credential Security.</strong> You must keep your credentials secure, use strong authentication, and never share tokens, passwords, or login sessions.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3 Least Privilege.</strong> You must request and use only the minimum access necessary to perform your job duties.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4 Responsibility for Activity.</strong> You are responsible for all activity performed using your access, whether authorized by you or not, unless caused by Onit's failure to implement reasonable security controls.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h2>5) Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1 Data Types.</strong> The App may process data such as: customer/contact info, deal details, product/service line items, pricing, tax fields, invoice templates, invoice amounts, payment terms, and related metadata ("App Data").</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Data Handling.</strong> Onit may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>read data from Pipedrive to populate invoices;</li>
          <li>transmit invoice and customer data to QuickBooks to create/update invoices;</li>
          <li>store limited configuration data needed to operate the App (e.g., template mappings, field mappings, user preferences, integration identifiers, error logs).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>5.3 Logs and Monitoring.</strong> Onit may collect operational telemetry and audit logs (e.g., timestamps, user IDs, actions taken, API responses, error details) to secure, maintain, and improve the App.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4 Confidentiality of Business Data.</strong> App Data is Onit confidential information (or Onit-controlled customer/client information) and must be handled under Section 6.</p>
        <p><strong>5.5 Privacy Notice/Policies.</strong> Where applicable, App Data handling is governed by Onit policies, including information security and privacy policies, plus any applicable customer agreements and legal requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>5.6 Data Accuracy.</strong> You are responsible for verifying invoice accuracy (customer, amount, tax, terms, line items) before sending or posting invoices. The App is an assistive tool, not a substitute for review.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h2>6) Confidentiality</h2>
        <p><strong>6.1 Confidential Information.</strong> The App, its design, documentation, source and object code, workflows, configurations, and non-public business information are Onit's confidential information ("Confidential Information").</p>
        <p><strong>6.2 Obligations.</strong> You will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>use Confidential Information only for Authorized Use;</li>
          <li>protect it using at least reasonable care and no less than the care you use for your own confidential information;</li>
          <li>not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except as required for Authorized Use and permitted by Onit and applicable agreements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>6.3 Exclusions.</strong> Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly available through no fault of yours, lawfully obtained from a third party without duty of confidentiality, or independently developed without use of Confidential Information.</p>
        <p><strong>6.4 Compelled Disclosure.</strong> If legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, you will provide Onit prompt notice (unless prohibited by law) and cooperate to seek protective treatment.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h2>7) Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p><strong>7.2 Feedback.</strong> If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant Onit the right to use them without restriction or compensation.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>8) Acceptable Use and Compliance</h2>

        <p><strong>8.2 Prohibited Data.</strong> You must not input or process data in violation of contractual obligations, privacy obligations, export controls, sanctions, or professional duties.</p>
        <p><strong>8.3 Recordkeeping.</strong> You must follow Onit's invoicing/accounting procedures, approval workflows, and record retention requirements.</p>

        <p><strong>9.1 Security Measures.</strong> Onit will use commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards appropriate to the App's risk profile.</p>

        <p><strong>9.3 No Security Testing Without Permission.</strong> You may not probe, scan, or test the App's security without Onit's prior written authorization.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>12) Disclaimers</h2>
        <p><strong>12.1 As-Is.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE."</p>

        <p><strong>13.2 Liability Cap.</strong> Onit's total liability arising out of or related to the App will not exceed $100 (or, if required by law and applicable, the amount paid by Onit for the App in the prior 12 months, which for an internal tool may be $0).</p>
        <p><strong>13.3 Basis of Bargain.</strong> These limitations apply even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
